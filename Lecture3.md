General-purpose visual modeling language
UML-Unified modelling language
Specify,visualise,construct,and document the artifacts of a softwarre system
Decisions and understanding about systems must be constructed.
Understand,design,configure,maintain, and control information about such systems.
IS it a standard:- The UML specification does not define a standard process but is intended to be useful with an iterative development process
UML is not a programming language but can be used to write programs
UML is intended to be a universal general-purpose modeling language for GUI layout, VLSI circuit design, or rule-based AI.
Developed in an effor to simplify and consolidate the large number of OO-development methods that had emerged.


Is it a enforced?
An effort to unify concepts among methods for books on OO-methodology appeared
1996-the Objject Management Group(OMG) issued a request for proposals for a standard approach to OO-modeling which has standardized in November 1997.
In 2005, UML 2.0 was introduced.
UML1 should have little trouble using UML2.
The UML combines the commonly accepted concepts from many 

Benefits of UML- Quick understanding,simplify complex systems,communicate design decisions, independent of tech used,system handover

Types-
14 types of UML diagrams
2 families of UML diagrams
The different diagrams allow for modeling a system from several separate, related viewpoints permit it to be understood for diff. purposes
Structural UML diagrams
-Class diagram
-Object diagram
-Package
-Component
-Composite structure
-Deployment
-Profile

Behavioural UML D
-Use
-Activity
-Sequence
-State
-Communication
-Interaction overview 
-Timing 

UML is a modeling language, not a description of a detailed development process

UML is not intended to be a complete development method. It does not include a step-by-step development process

Complexity: product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests. It shares the qualities of the project of a democratic process.
It is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will.
It contains cuperfluous features(but different persons might disagree about prei

Tension bw concepts for conceptual modeling and programming language representaion, with no consistent guidelines,

Don't need to know/use every feature of UML any more than need to know or use every feature of a large software application of prog. lang.

What is OO Analysis and Design

Identify objects
define relationships
establish interface
making design executable
