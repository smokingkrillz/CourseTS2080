Visualise functional requirements

The purpose of a use case is to define a piece of coherent behaviour without revealing the internal structure of the subject.
help visualise func. req. of a system, including the relationship of "actors" to the essential processes, as well as the relationships among diff. use cases.
further interactions can be defined as statechart diagrams, sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, or informal descriptions. Do not crowd this diagram.
A use case describes an interaction with actors as a sequence of messages bw the system and one or more actors.

A system boundary: defines the scope and limits of the system. It is shown as a rectangle that spans all use cases of the system
Actors:
Generalisation- an actor can inherit the role of another actor.
associations- a line bw the actor and the use case

Extending use case is optional(usually) and can be triggered conditionally.
must be meaningful on its own; it should be independent and must not rely on the behaviour of the extending use case.

Include: include relationship represents an invocation of one use case by another use case .
the base use case is incomplete  without the included use case.
have a subject name
