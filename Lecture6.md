Class diagrams
Description : Desribes the types of objects that can be created
Attributes of the classes: any variables that is bound in a class
Operations of class that can occur
Relationships between these objects

Class diagrams: have three parts-name, variables : type ,methods
Relationships bw these objects:
An association is a solid line between  2 classes directed from the source class to the target class. The name of the property goes at the target end of the association,together with its multiplicity

The multiplicity of a property is an indication of how many object may fill the property. Lower bound and an 


Inheritance is the concept of aquiring the resource from parents or base class by the child class.

class which allows its properties to be shared is known as the parent class and the class which aquires the properties from its parent class is known as the child class.
greatly reduces the need to code again and allows code reusability

Composition : A has an instance of B. B cannot exist without A.
Aggregation dont worry

An abstract class, cannot be instantiated.

designed to be inherited by subclasses that implement or override its methods.
Abstract classes are either partially implmented or not implemented at all.

Functionality in your abstract class- the methods in an abstract class can be both abstract and concrete.

Can take advantage of abstract classes to design components and specify some level of standard functionality that must be implemented by dervied classes.
