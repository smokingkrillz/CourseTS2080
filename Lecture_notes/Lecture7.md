# Activity diagrams

Diagram Details
It represents the flow of control in a system

It emphasizes the condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens
We can also use an activity diagram to refer to the steps involved in executing a use case.
Skeleton of Activity Diagram
Vertical swim lines, horizontal swim lines

when you want to acheieve a number of different things that require coordination, use activity diagrams

# Sequence Diagrams
Shows you an interaction between elements
detailed flow of an activity diagram
SD- describe interactions among elements in terms of an exchange in terms of an exchange of messages over time and are used to explore the logic of complex operations, functions or procedures.
The sequence of interactions bw the objects is represented in a step-by-step manner.
show a detailed flow for a specific use case or even just part of a particilar ue case.

two dimensions- vertical dimension shows the sequence of messages in chronological order that they occur, the horizontal dimension shows the object instances to which messages are sent.

a LIFEline --------
Activations- a thin rectange
Call message
return message
self-message

SD- closer to th code level
still a bit above the level of the actual code
language neutral
easier to do sequence d as a tem, can be used
